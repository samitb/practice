 					                          GoF Creational Patterns

Abstract Factory 	Sets of methods to make various objects.
Builder 	        Make and return one object various ways.
Factory Method   	Methods to make and return components of one object various ways.
Prototype 	        Make new objects by cloning the objects which you set as prototypes.
Singleton 	        A class distributes the only instance of itself.



					                            GoF Structural Patterns
Adapter 	    A class extends another class, takes in an object, and makes the taken object behave like the extended class.
Bridge 	        An abstraction and implementation are in different class hierarchies.
Composite 	    Assemble groups of objects with the same signature.
Decorator 	    One class takes in another class, both of which extend the same abstract class, and adds functionality.
Facade 	        One class has a method that performs a complex process calling several other classes.
Flyweight 	    The reusable and variable parts of a class are broken into two classes to save resources.
Proxy 	        One class controls the creation of and access to objects in another class.




					      						GoF Behavorial Patterns
Chain Of Responsibility 	A method called in one class can move up a hierarchy to find an object that can properly execute the method.
Command 					An object encapsulates everything needed to execute a method in another object.
Interpreter 				Define a macro language and syntax, parsing input into objects which perform the correct opertaions.
Iterator 					One object can traverse the elements of another object.
Mediator 					An object distributes communication between two or more objects.
Memento 					One object stores another objects state.
Observer 					An object notifies other object(s) if it changes.
State 						An object appears to change its` class when the class it passes calls through to switches itself for a related class.
Strategy 					An object controls which of a family of methods is called. Each method is in its` own class that extends a common base class.
Template 					An abstract class defines various methods, and has one non-overridden method which calls the various methods.
Visitor 					One or more related classes have the same method, which calls a method specific for themselves in another class.
